# Hey there! 🫡

Here's a bit about me!
* I'm a recent bootcamp graduate looking to become a software engineer with a particular interest in physiology and medical technology.
* I'm challenging myself to do at least 1 hour of code everyday for 100 days! (11 April '23 - 20 July '23)
<br>

Projects that I'm currently working on 🧱 ...
* Slowly chipping away at LeetCode questions 💀💀💀
* Building my personal portfolio 🙋
* A discord bot that can track the frequency of specific phrases and maybe some other fun features 🤖

<br>

Projects that I'm planning to do in the future ⏳ ... 
* Brushing up on my JS with small projects ( typing practice tool similar to [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) and a chrome extension of a pomodoro timer 🍅 ) 
* an AirBnB clone using React and TypeScript ⚛️
<br>

I'm looking for 👀 ...
* Any learning resources that have been proven useful to you that'll help me - especially data structure and algorithm related content
* Any projects you've found that you think I'd find interesting!
* Any connections even if you just want to have a quick chat!
