# Hey there! 🫡

Here's a bit about me!

* I enjoy lifting (moderately) heavy weights 🏋️ and swinging around on gymnastic rings 🐒
* I'm challenging myself to do at least 1 hour of code everyday for 100 days! (11 April '23 - 20 July '23)
<br>

Projects that I'm currently working on 🧱 ...
* Building my personal portfolio
* Brushing up on my JS with small projects ( typing practice tool similar to [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) ) 
* Slowly chipping away at LeetCode questions 💀💀💀
<br>

Projects that I'm planning to do in the near future ⏳ ... 
* an AirBnB clone using React and TypeScript ⚛️
* Start working on some coding challenges! ⚙
<br>

I'm looking for 👀 ...
* Any learning resources that have been proven useful to you that'll help me - especially LeetCode related content! 
* Any projects you've found that you think I'd find interesting!
