# Hey there! 🫡

Here's a bit about me!
* I'm a bootcamp graduate with a background in scientific research looking to become a software engineer with a particular interest in physiology, automation and problem solving.
<br>

Projects that I'm currently working on 🧱 ...
* Slowly chipping away at LeetCode questions 💀💀💀
* A mini project where I can add some reviews to some books I've read 📚

<br>

Projects that I'm planning to do in the future ⏳ ... 
* Brushing up on my JS with small projects ( typing practice tool similar to [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/) and a chrome extension of a pomodoro timer 🍅 )
* A visualiser to show keyboard inputs ( similar to OBS plugin tool [Input Overlay](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/input-overlay.552/) ) ⌨️ 
* Building my personal portfolio 🙋
* Learning more about Deep Q-Learning 🧠
<br>

I'm looking for 👀 ...
* Any learning resources that have been proven useful to you that'll help me - especially data structure and algorithm related content
* Any projects you've found that you think I'd find interesting!
* Any connections even if you just want to have a quick chat!
